# Auth Application Client

This is the client code of the complete Authetication application. It uses Passport local strategy for the login. Also once user is logged in, the user details are stored in the localStorage so that user can be logged in for next visit witout asking for the username and passport.

Using axios it communicates with the AuthApplication.herokuapp.com APIs created by me.
